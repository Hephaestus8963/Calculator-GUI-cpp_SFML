# A Calculator app in C++ using SFML
This is a GUI of a calculator that I made using cpp and SFML. It can perform basic tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It does so using my own implementation of the shunting yard algorithm.

The executable is located in the bin folder with all required .dll files from sfml. You are free to use that or build the index.cpp file as per instructions from the official sfml dev tutorials page. The required library files are window, system and graphics. As of now the app is 
64-bit meaning it requires the -m64 tag at linking stage (could not figure out how to set it to 32-bit ðŸ’€).
